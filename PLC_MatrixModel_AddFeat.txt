Partial Life-cycle Matrix Model - Additional Features

1. Age-specific Survival and Fecundity

For well-studied species, estimates of age-specific survival and fecundity are sometimes available.
These estimates could be specific to the age of an individual or to a broader age class. For example,
birds just reaching sexual maturity may have lower fecundity because they have a harder time
establishing territories and finding mates. Such a distinction is an important modeling consideration.
I built my model with the capacity to utilize age-specific survival and fecundity inputs.

2. Flexible Parameter Input Design

It is not uncommon for the demographic data that is available to vary between study species. Some 
researchers may have estimates for nest success, post-fledging survival, and other reproductive parameters, 
while others may only know fecundity. As such, I built my model with the capacity to utilize a wide 
variety of parameter inputs. The user can construct population growth models whose accuracy reflect the 
resolution of the available data. This flexibility extends to reproductive rates, survival rates, and 
estimates of stochasticity.

3. Elasticity Analysis

Population modeling is often coupled with a sensitivity or elasticity analysis in studies of declining
species. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the most sensitive life stage; this maximizes the
efficiency of any subsequent management action. I built an elasticity analysis into the structure of my
model that can be turned on and customized by the user. It tests each parameter used by the model, 
identifies the least and most elastic, and provides delta values for direct comparisons.
